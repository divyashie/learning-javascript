---------- ALL SELECTORS & THEIR SPECIFICITY ---------- 

Example: the color of a certain p tag can be: blue or white, but not both. 
CSS engines use specificity to resolve these conflicts. It helps ranking or 
score that helps CSS determine the final rule that will be applied to a given 
element. 

Note: these rules will only be applied to a specific property. 

---------- Specificity hierarchy -----------

CSS has a set of rules that it uses to 'score' or assign a certain weight to selectors and this 
creates a specificity hierarchy: 
    - Inline styles 
    - IDs 
    - Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes 
    - Elements and pseudo-elements 

---------- Inline Styles -----------
Inline styles are attached to the elements within your HTML code like with the 'style' attribute. 
Inline styles have the highest specificity. That means that rules that are defined as inline styles 
will be applied irrespective of other rules. 

<p styles="color: white;"> 
p{color: blue} 

The p tag will be colored white because it is declared inside the inline tag. 

------------ IDs ------------------

represents by "#": for example, #div 

    classes, attributes, and psuedo-classes 
    .my-class 
    p["attribute"]
    div:hover 

    Elements and pseudo-elements: 
    Lowest position in the specificity hierarchy 

---------- Calculating Scores --------------
CSS uses hierarchical model internally to calculate the specificity of the selectors used on the web page. 
As the size of CSS code increases, developers unavoidably face rule conflicts. 
Devs use the specificity hierarchy to calculate the precedence of CSS rules and to control the outcome of their web pages. 

Example: 

p{} => 1 element => 0001 => score 1 
div p {} => 2 elements => 0002 => score 2 
div p.foo {} => 2 elements and 1 class selector => 0012 => score 12 

Since the 3rd case (12) for the p tag has the highest specificity, the rules for the other two cases are then overriden 
and the rules inside the third case are applied. 

Example 2: 
p#bar => 1 element & ID => 0101 => Score: 101 
p.foo => 1 element & 1 class => 0011 => Score: 11 
p.p.foo => 1 element & 2 class => 0021 => Score: 21 

Note: In cases when the score for different selectors is the same, here are some guidelines: 
    - Every selector will have a score and place in the hierarchy. 
    - In the case of selectors with equal specificity, the latest or last written rule is the one that will be applied. 
    - In general, ID selector should be applied in cases where you need to be certain about a rule. 
    - Universal selectors have 0 specificity value.
