PSUEDO ELEMENT 

Psuedo-elements help you style a specific part of an element. 
E.g., You can decide to apply styling to only the first word or line 
in a given element. 

Let's examine the syntax of a psuedo-element. 

--------- SYNTAX  --------
selector::pseudo-element {
    property: value; 
}

Psuedo-elements use 2 colon characters instead of one. 

--------- FIRST-LETTER ------- 
You can use first-letter to change the color of just the first letter of each of
of 3 points in the example text. 

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
    <head> 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="pseudo4.css"> 
    </head> 
    <body> 
        <ul> 
            <li>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. </li> 
            <li>The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.</li> 
            <li>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.</li> 
        </ul> 
    </body> 
    </html> 

CSS code: 

li::first-letter {
    color: coral; 
    font-size: 1.3em; 
    font-weight: bold; 
    line-height: 1;
}

------------- FIRST-LINE -------------
First-line will change the complete first line of each of the bullet points to light sea green. 

CSS Code: 

ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

li::first-line {
    color: lightseagreen; 
    text-decoration: underline; 
    line-height: 1; 
}

Since it is the only first line of each bullet point, 
it almost functions like dividers between the 3 different 
points instead of having to rely on bullets. 

Note: the contents of the line to which this psuedo-element 
is applied will change as you increase or decrease the size of 
your viewport. 

--------- SELECTION ----- 
E.g., when you are taking notes on your device, it allows you to 
highlight specific text. 
On web pages, you will typically see inverted colors from white-black 
to black-white when selecting a portion of text. 

CSS Code: 

ul {
    list-style-type: none; 
}

li::selection {
    color: brown; 
    background-color: antiquewhite; 
    line-height: 1; 
}

Different segments of the text are highlighted 
depending on the text that is selected at any given 
point. 

----------- MARKER -------------
Markers are typically used to add style 
elements to a list, e.g., to color bullet 
points. E.g., you can enhance the user experience 
when you use a marker in the following way. 

CSS code: 

li::marker {
    color: cornflowerblue; 
    content: '<> '; 
    font-size: 1.1em; 
}

Now the bullet points are cornflower blue and they have the shape specified in the code. 

--------- BEFORE AND AFTER ---------
One more pair of psuedo-elements are ::before and ::after psuedo-elements. 
They allow you to add content before and after an element on which they are 
allowed. New content can be added to a page without adding HTML code for it. 
You can also add styling options for this content. 
Example: where text is added both before and after some cooking guidelines 
to identify them as important tips. 

HTML Code: 
<body> 
    <p id="tips"> Don't rinse your pasta after it is drained. </p> 
    <p> Slice the tomatoes. Take the extra efforts to seed them. </p> 
    <p id="tips"> Peel and seed large tomatoes. </p> 
</body> 

CSS Code: 

#tips::before{
    background: darkkhaki; 
    color: darkslategray; 
    content: "Tip:"; 
    padding-left: 3px; 
    padding-right: 5px; 
    border-radius: 10%; 
}

#tips::after{
    background: darkkhaki; 
    color: darkslategray; 
    content: "!!"; 
    padding-right: 5px; 
    border-radius: 20%; 
}

Psuedo-elements can greatly enhance the appearance of websites.
