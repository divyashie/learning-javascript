    GRID TEMPLATE AREA 
    1. group one or more grid cells 
    2. grid template area is an extension of this concept where you can give names to these grid areas. 
    3. Using their name definition, you can address new grid area items by their names and configure them 
        accordingly. 
    4. Usually placed inside the body tag or any container where the grid needs to be placed. 
        Similarly, you would define the rules for the grid. 
    5. Main difference: grid-template-areas the values present will be the different names. 

    PROCESS 
    It isn't prescriptive but these steps are in general: 
    - define the grid using display property 
    - set the height and width of the grid 
    - set the grid-template-areas with the appropriate name identifiers 
    - add the appropriate sizes for the rows inside the grid using grid-template-columns property. 

    The HTML tags that you have used inside the grid template areas are the names. 
    For specificity, you designate a class name to these tags. 
    Once the names are assigned, you define the properties for each class the same way that you define them conventionally.

<body>
    <header> Header </header>
    <nav class="nav-bar"> Navigation </nav>
    <main> Main area </main>
    <footer> Footer </footer>

body {
    display: grid; 
    height: 200px; 
    grid-template-areas: "head head" 
                        "nav main"
                        "footer footer"; 
    grid-template-rows: 30px 1fr 30px; 
    grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr; 
}

header {
    grid-area: header; 
    background-color: lightsalmon;
}

.nav-bar{
    grid-area: nav; 
    background-color: lightblue; 
}

main{
    grid-area: main; 
    background-color: lightyellow; 
}

footer{
    grid-area: footer; 
    background-color: firebrick; 
}

<!--
    Logically the CSS code is divided into 2 sections. 
    1. You define the rules for the grid inside the body selector. 
    2. You allocate specific rules for the different grid areas. 
        Grid areas are distributed as per your names definition inside the grid-template-areas property. 

    ABOVE CSS CODE: 
    'head' written 2x implies 2 columns and the rest of the content follows the usual convention. 
    #rows = #pairs of quotes used (here is 3: head head, nav main, footer footer) 
    #rows, #columns will be set by the values of grid-template-rows & grid-template-columns. 
    height simply gives the overall value of the height for the grid. 

    Note: the height and width of grid-areas can be distributed proportionately when names are correctly added. 
    Grid areas are convenient once you have a clear schematic of what you want in a grid. 
    Easier to configure individual areas if you can address them by their names. 
    Creating a block diagram using pen and paper before starting to work on a grid is always a good idea.
